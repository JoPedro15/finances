## Built-in Security Controls

This repository enforces automated security scanning on every push:

- **SAST Analysis:** Static code scanning with `bandit` (`make security-check`).
- **Dependency Auditing:** CVE checks against known vulnerability databases via `pip-audit`.
- **Secrets Protection:** `.env`, `secrets/credentials.json`, and `secrets/token.json` are excluded from source control via `.gitignore`. Never commit credentials.

## User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for protecting your `GEMINI_API_KEY`, Google Cloud OAuth credentials, and Discord webhook URLs. The author is not liable for financial loss or unauthorized access resulting from leaked secrets or improper local configuration.
